This file saved the augmented data for training.   
The current training image is 64 * 64 (because it runs faster), and in the report we use 256 * 256 to get better performance.   
If you want to change the training image size, please revise the image height and weight in pre_data.py. Before get new augmented data, please clean the previous images, in order to avoid errors.
